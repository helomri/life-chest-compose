The application Life Chest does not send any user personal data to anyone (even its creators).
The user's privacy is our priority.
All possible data we harvest is provided by Google analytics and only monitors the application
growth (installation success rate, total downloads, impressions and other metrics all in
this same scope) for statistical purpose and are in no way related to user behavior in the app.
